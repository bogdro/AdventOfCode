# Advent of code 2023 #

## Languages ##

Perl.

## Why? ##

Perl is really good at text processing. It has:
- built-in support for regular expressions (operators for match `//` and substitute `s///`),
- easy file reading, especially from standard input (1 line),
- easy support for arrays and hash tables,
- default variables (`$_` and `$n` for matched groups).

## Solutions ##

Naive and KISS. Result correct? Remove loggers, debugs, ship it, charge for it :)
